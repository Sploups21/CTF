For this challenge, a ZIP file was given. Let's extract it :

Seems like we have an appdata folder. Let's do a tree on it to find the Profile folder (this is were all Firefox user data is stored) :

<strong> ðŸ¡† Profile folder : 3y1wxf49.default-release </strong>


Now that we have the Profile folder, we can dump all the passwords from it with this tool : https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt

I launch the script with the Profile folder as a target and get the flag :
