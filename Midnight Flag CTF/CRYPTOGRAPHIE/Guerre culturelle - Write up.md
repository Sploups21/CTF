After some research on Google, I didn't find any useful informations ðŸ˜¥ <br>

Let's try the Cipher identifier of Dcode : https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier

All right, didn't knew that Chuck Norris was a fan of esoteric languages ðŸ˜¹ Let's try if Dcode is right :

Well, it seems that it is !
